   ************* Beginning Zone Sizing Calculations
   ** Warning ** GetAirflowNetworkInput: SurfaceAverageCalculation is entered for field = Wind Pressure Coefficient Type, but no roof surface is defined using an AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surface object.
   **   ~~~   ** Reconsider if this is your modeling intent. Simulation continues.
   ** Warning ** GetAirflowNetworkInput: SurfaceAverageCalculation is entered for field = Wind Pressure Coefficient Type.
   **   ~~~   ** The AirflowNetwork model provides wind pressure coefficients for 4 vertical exterior orientations and 1 horizontal roof.
   **   ~~~   **  There are only 0 exterior surface orientations defined in this input file using AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surface objects.
   **   ~~~   ** Reconsider if this is your modeling intent. Simulation continues.
   ** Warning ** GetPurchasedAir: ZoneHVAC:IdealLoadsAirSystem="ZN1 IDEAL LOADS AIR SYSTEM missing data
   **   ~~~   ** ZN1 IDEAL LOADS OUTDOOR AIR INLET does not appear in an OutdoorAir:NodeList or as an OutdoorAir:Node.
   **   ~~~   ** Adding OutdoorAir:Node=ZN1 IDEAL LOADS OUTDOOR AIR INLET
