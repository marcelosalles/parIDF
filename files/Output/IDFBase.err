   ************* Beginning Zone Sizing Calculations
   ** Warning ** GetAirflowNetworkInput: SurfaceAverageCalculation is entered for field = Wind Pressure Coefficient Type, but no roof surface is defined using an AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surface object.
   **   ~~~   ** Reconsider if this is your modeling intent. Simulation continues.
   ** Warning ** GetAirflowNetworkInput: SurfaceAverageCalculation is entered for field = Wind Pressure Coefficient Type.
   **   ~~~   ** The AirflowNetwork model provides wind pressure coefficients for 4 vertical exterior orientations and 1 horizontal roof.
   **   ~~~   **  There are only 0 exterior surface orientations defined in this input file using AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surface objects.
   **   ~~~   ** Reconsider if this is your modeling intent. Simulation continues.
   ************* Beginning System Sizing Calculations
   ** Warning ** SizeDXCoil Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed ZN1_HVAC COOLING COIL
   **   ~~~   ** ...Gross Rated Total Cooling Capacity [W] will be limited by the maximum rated volume flow per rated total capacity ratio.
   **   ~~~   ** ...DX coil volume flow rate ( m3/s ) = 0.280887
   **   ~~~   ** ...Requested capacity ( W ) = 4416.470
   **   ~~~   ** ...Requested flow/capacity ratio ( m3/s/W ) = 6.359E-005
   **   ~~~   ** ...Maximum flow/capacity ratio ( m3/s/W ) = 6.041E-005
   **   ~~~   ** ...Adjusted capacity ( W ) = 4649.681
   ** Warning ** For zone=ZN1 return air heat gain from lights will be applied to the zone air.
   **   ~~~   **   This zone has no return air or is served by an on/off HVAC system.
